Receive yacht navigation data from a SignalK server and show it on Arduino devices connected with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
 
* with a server implemented on node.js, get navigation data from a SignalK delta stream over a web socket and forward it to a connected BLE display device.

* On an Adafruit nRF52 module with an OLED display, receive data over BLE and display it.

* For now, use the Nordic UART profile for data delivery.
